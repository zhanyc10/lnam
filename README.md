This is a publicly available Python package to conduct linear network autocorrelation analysis for large-scale social network in a fast speed.

The search_all algorithm and search_rho algorithm are implemented in the Git_vs folder model.py.
The algTest.py initiate a simulation that randomly generate 4 independent variables and 3 network adjacency matrix.
By replacing the dependent variable vector Y, independent variable X, and network adjacency matrix W, the algorithm can be applied to other datasets.
